# React Chrome Extension Template

A basic template for building a [Chrome Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started) using React.

## Build

Build your extension using `pnpm build`.

## Test

To test your extension, first toggle "Developer Mode" in the Chrome extensions page.
Then, click "Load Unpacked", and select the `build/manifest.json` in this repository.

You will now be able to see the extension in Chrome.

You will need to click the "reload" arrow whenever you rebuild the extension, (and refresh a web page to reload any `content.js` scripts)

## Watch

Run `pnpm watch` to continuously watch for changes
